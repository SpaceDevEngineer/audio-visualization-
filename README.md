# audio-classification-project
This project focuses on classifying audio signals using advanced feature extraction and machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of spoken digits, and the model is trained to identify them based on extracted features such as statistical measures, frequency-domain analysis, and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
